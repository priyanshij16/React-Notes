React under the Hood :

A Catch in Reconcilliation:

Ex:'
<div className="class-1">
	<p>I did not change</p>
</div> '
If you change the jsx like below:

'<p className="class-1">
	<p>I did not change</p>  </p>'

If the parent element has been change then Dom will destroy all respective childern and recreate it from top to bottom.
it uses cleaups() function which are define in return { } of useEffect.
