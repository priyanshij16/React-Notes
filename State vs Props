     STATE VS PROPS:

props : are read only components which pass from parents to child .
Props are immutable, meaning a child component cannot modify them.

function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

<Greeting name="John" />

         STATE:
State is a built-in React object that stores dynamic data .
It enables a component to keep track of its own data .

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
