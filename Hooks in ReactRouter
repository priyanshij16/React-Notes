 Link Vs Route :
Route tag renders a component based on URL. 
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
While Link tag creates navigation links, ensure seamless transition .


#### useHistory Hook::
part of react Router, programmatic way to naviagte between the diff pages.
useHistory() hook provides access to history object, which allow to see navigation history.
The `history` object provides several methods that you can use to manipulate the navigation history:

- push(path, [state]): Adds a new entry to the history stack and navigates to the specified path. 

- go(n): Moves the pointer in the history stack by `n` entries. A positive `n` goes forward, and a negative `n` goes backward.

- goBack(): Equivalent to `go(-1)`, it navigates back to the previous entry in the history stack.

    CODE: 
 const history = useHistory();
    useEffect(() => {
        console.log("MemoryRouter - initial location: ", history.location);
        history.listen((location) => {
          console.log("MemoryRouter - changed location: ", location);
          setCurrentPath(location.pathname);
        });
      }, [history]);
